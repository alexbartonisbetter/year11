These <b><i>paragraphs</i></b> are here to fill the page with HTML errors.
Some of these errors will be <i>stylistically hideous</i>, others will be just plane
weird. Be sure to read through the code line by line and analyze the mistakes in
the HTML as well as in the browser. Some mistakes may work visually in your browser,
 so don't let any mistakes <i>slide through</i>.
